In case of employment of mathadis, hamals, manual workers, and private security guards, the State Government reserves rights to ascertain time limits for payment of wages. Where the concerned authorities find certain employers to be defaulters, they may compel such employers to deposit an average amount of monthly wages payable to workers.

Private security guards are entitled to full payment of wages even in cases where the employers (usually security agencies) are unable to provide them with complete or partial employment; despite the guards being available for duty.
